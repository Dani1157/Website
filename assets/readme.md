Yesss got you 💙
I’ll write you a **clean, professional README.md** in the **same structure and level** as the Paris project you shared — but **adapted perfectly to your “Travel Stories” website** and the story page you built.

You can **copy-paste this directly into your README.md** on GitHub.

# Travel Stories Website

## Overview

Travel Stories is a responsive, story-driven travel website designed to showcase real journeys from around the world. The project focuses on immersive storytelling, clean design, and intuitive navigation. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the website delivers a smooth user experience across all devices while highlighting travel stories, galleries, testimonials, and contact functionality.

The site encourages users to explore destinations through authentic narratives rather than traditional travel guides.
